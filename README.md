# Project

## This is a Java Project that I have done when I was attending at the University of Nebraska Lincoln.

This program will take in a MySQL database and give a Portfolio report according the tables. The data must provide the users portfolio based on Accounts. The Java program has a abstract class called Accounts which will proide information to the Deposit Account, Savings Account, and Personal Investment classes. 

Every Portfolio is then stored into a Linked List and then outputed into a more readable format.
